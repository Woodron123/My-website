    <p>     So basically there are certain things you need to be able to get into ceratin colleges. You need to have the required SAT/ACT score, a certain amount of volunteer hours, you need to have taken certain clasees, etc. etc, etc. etc.</p>
    <p>     To me it's quite a hassle to have to organize all this information so I am going to format the top 10 colleges I can currently get into in the following format.
    <h3>College name</h3>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/State_Normal_School_Building.jpg" alt="random school building" width=400px>
    <ul>
        <li>requirment</li>
        <li>requirment</li>
        <li>requirment</li>
        <li>requirment</li>
        <li>requirment</li>
        <li>requirment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I can then add some basic information here yada yada yada.</p>
    <p>without further a due, Esketit!</p>
    <h2> My College Picks </h2>
    <h3>Number 1 - University Of Georgia (AKA UGA)</h3>
    <img src="https://news.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/east-campus.jpg" alt="UGA campus" width=400px>
    <ul>
        <li>GPA --- 4.0</li>
        <li>SAT score --- 1240</li>
        <li>Volunteer hours</li>
        <li>letters of reccomendation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With a right balance of requirments my chances of getting into UGA are OK. If I can boost my SAT scores and GPA this year, then my chance will become even higher. My current job at Publix will also surely help me get great reccomendation letters and a good amount of volunteer hours. And I can probably reach out to the office of admissions so I can stand out in the application process. Personally I believe UGA is within grasping range. </p>
    <h3>Number 2 - Perimeter College - GSU</h3>
    <img src="https://perimeter.gsu.edu/files/2019/06/AB-3775-facilities.jpg" alt="UGA campus" width=400px>
    <ul>
        <li>GPA --- 3.5</li>
        <li>SAT score --- 1090</li>
        <li>Volunteer hours</li>
        <li>letters of reccomendation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If I can't get into UGA on the get-go thats okay because I have a plan B. Perimeter College - GSU is a great public school to go to ranking #6 on best community colleges of 2023. Best of all there transfer rate into UGA is 75.63%. Thats a win for sure, but to top it off I already surpass the requirments to get into this college with my GPA and test score alone. And if I throw in some Volunteer hours and reccomendation letter as well, my ticket to getting into GSU is as googd as gold. This college is my Plan B and I can easily put it in my list of Saftey schools</p>
    <h2> Pause and think </h2>
    <p> At this point my chances of getting where I want to go is great. But Lets say for whatever reason I don't happen to get into either of the colleges or say I can't because of this reason or that reason. I need to apply to other colleges worst case scenario to succeed in life and Its not bad to have a Plan C, D, E, or F. Not to mention this is a project I'm doing and I need to list out 10 colleges. So without Furthe ado let me list the other 8 colleges that I can potentially go to.
